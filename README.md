# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Express Sample API
This sample application uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework to build a simple, scalable RESTful API that is deployed to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). The application stores data in [Amazon DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and publishes notifications to the [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/).
